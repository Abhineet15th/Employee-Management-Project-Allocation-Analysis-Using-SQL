# Employee-Management-Project-Allocation-Analysis-Using-SQL
A small SQL project where I created a custom dataset and performed various queries to analyze employees and their projects. 

This project is a **SQL-based Employee Management & Project Allocation System**, where I have created a small dataset from scratch to showcase my SQL proficiency. Despite being a small-scale project, it demonstrates my ability to **design databases, write queries, and perform meaningful data analysis**.  

#### **Project Overview:**  
- Designed and implemented a **relational database** for managing **employees and projects**.  
- Created two tables:  
  - `Employees`: Stores employee details like ID, name, address, and salary.  
  - `EmployeeProjects`: Tracks project assignments, including start and end dates.  
- Inserted **20 records** in both tables, ensuring a diverse dataset for analysis.  

#### **Key SQL Operations Performed:**  
âœ” **Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS)** â€“ To analyze employee-project relationships.  
âœ” **Aggregation & Grouping** â€“ Count of employees per project, highest-paid employees per project.  
âœ” **Filtering & Date Functions** â€“ Employees working on ongoing projects, projects ending in 2025, projects lasting more than 6 months.  
âœ” **Self-Join** â€“ Finding employees with the same salary.  
âœ” **Subqueries** â€“ Identifying the highest-paid employee in each project.  
âœ” **Set Operations (UNION)** â€“ Merging employee and project data into a unified view.  

#### **Why This Project?**  
I know this is a **small project**, but I built it entirely by myself to showcase my **SQL understanding**. From designing the schema to writing complex queries, this project reflects my ability to work with **real-world data scenarios** and draw **meaningful insights** from structured datasets.  

âœ… **Built Using:** MySQL  
âœ… **Skills Demonstrated:** Database Design, Query Writing, Data Analysis
